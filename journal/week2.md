# Week 2 ‚Äî Distributed Tracing

## Welcome to week 2!
Our focus on this week is as the name implies distributed tracing. What is Distributed Tracing?
Distributed tracing is a technique that addresses logging information in microservice-based applications


## Install Honeycomb

On the backend-flask/requirements.text, add the following code

File name can be anything you want, it doesnt have to be requirements.txt
```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```

install the dependency. this will necessary just this time as it will be run via docker compose
```
pip install -r {filename}.txt
```

Add the following on the app.py
```
# Honeycomb
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Honeycomb
# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Honeycomb
# Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
```

from the docker-compose.yml, add the following code for the env variables
```
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: 'backend-flask'
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
```

from honeycomb.io, grab the unique code and create the gitpod env var
```
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
```

To create span and attribute, add the following code on the home_activities.py
```
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer("home.activities")
```

```
with tracer.start_as_current_span("home-activities-mock-data"):
    span = trace.get_current_span()
```
```
span.set_attribute("app.now", now.isoformat())
 ```
 at the end of the code, put the following
 ```
span.set_attribute("app.result_lenght", len(results))

 ```

***A poem to liven up the mood***
```
I faced a block, a backend woe üòî
For hours I tried, but nothing would flow ü§î
Then, a eureka moment came to me üí°
A missing requirements.txt file was the key üîë

Take note, dear friend, remember its name üìù
And in the backend-flask directory, install the same üíª
Don't let this mishap cause you strife üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Stay sharp and code on with newfound life! üí™üöÄ

```


## Install Xray

 check the env var for the AWS region using the following command
 ```
 env | grep AWS_REGION
 ```

 If there is no result
 ```
export AWS_REGION="ca-central-1"
gp env AWS_REGION="ca-central-1"

 ```

from the backend-flask requirements.text, insert the following
```
aws-xray-sdk
```

install the dependency. this will necessary just this time as it will be run via docker compose
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Insert the following code inside the app.py

```
# Xray
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware
```
```
# Xray
xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
```

Create xray.json inside the folder of /aws/json/ and insert the following code

```
{
    "SamplingRule": {
        "RuleName": "Cruddur",
        "ResourceARN": "*",
        "Priority": 9000,
        "FixedRate": 0.1,
        "ReservoirSize": 5,
        "ServiceName": "backend-flask",
        "ServiceType": "*",
        "Host": "*",
        "HTTPMethod": "*",
        "URLPath": "*",
        "Version": 1
    }
  }
```

launch the following command from to create the group on xray from the backend-flask folder
```
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask")"
```

from the main folder type the following command to create the sample rule
```
aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
```

add this line for the dockercompose.yml
```
AWS_XRAY_URL: "*4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}*"
AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: "xray-daemon:2000"
```
this code will create the daemon necessary for Xray
```
xray-daemon:
    image: "amazon/aws-xray-daemon"
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
      AWS_REGION: "eu-west-2"
    command:
      - "xray -o -b xray-daemon:2000"
    ports:
      - 2000:2000/udp
```

```
simple_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(simple_processor)
```

```
# xray
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```
